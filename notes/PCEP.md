# PCEP Points
# Operators 
 - With all mathematical operators except division - if you use 2 integers then you get integer, but a float in any position will produce float
 - Division will always produce a float
 - In Modulo division e.g., x % y, if y > x then the result is always x e.g., 20 % 30 is 20
 
# Functions
 - The input function always returns a string TBD on how to take other data types as input...
